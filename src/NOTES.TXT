 while running xml file, class not found exception
 include package name also:
 ex : <class name="Package1.Sample2" />
 
 in command prompt to run testng
 java -classpath .:testng-5.10-jdk15.jar org.testng.TestNG -groups groupB -testclass SampleTest
 
 run as testng suite comes in package editor, option not comes in editor to right click and run
 
 beforegroup and aftergroup annotation not executes if there no groups tests
 beforemethod, beforeclass and aftermethod, afterclass annotation not executes if there no @test methods
 
 beforetest, beforesuite and aftertest, aftertest annotaion executes irresspective of @Test presence
 
 in testng.xml, groups tag must have run tag
 ex: <groups>
			<run>
			<include name = "group2"> </include>
			<exclude name="group1"></exclude>
			</run>
		</groups>
		
methods tag should be inside class tag
ex : <classes>
			<class name="Package1.Sample4" />
			<methods>

				<include name="Test1">
				</include>

			</methods>
		</classes>
		
		
if we want to run the dependent testcase if its parent testcase failed, use alwaysrun = true 

even if we use alwaysrun = true, below methods will not execute
beforegroup and aftergroup annotation not executes if there no groups tests
beforemethod, beforeclass and aftermethod, afterclass annotation not executes if there no @test methods

classlevel enabled = false
all before and after annotation methods will not run, but @test methods will run.
to avoid @test execution, we should explistly specify enabled = false for @test methods

methodlevel enabled = false
only oartuicular method will not run
